# Introduction

* **Microfluidic devices use networks of miniature channels (often tens to hundreds of micrometers in width and depth) to manipulate small volumes of fluids. These devices have become essential in chemical and biological applications due to their ability to achieve precise control of flow and chemical environments.

* **Pinch flow fractionation (PFF)** is one technique used in microfluidics for continuously sorting particles by size. In PFF, two streams (one carrying particles, one without) meet in a narrow “pinched” region, aligning all particles to one channel wall. As the channel expands, larger particles are pushed farther into the expanding flow than smaller ones, effectively separating them by size. 

* **A specific example that requires sorting of small particles is **cell separation** for biomedical diagnostics. For instance, isolating tumor cells from blood relies on continuous flow fractionation to separate cells based on size differences.  
  
* **According to Yamada et al. (2004) [Anal. Chem. 2004, 76, 5465–5471,](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ac049863r) pinch flow fractionation is a robust method for separating particles in a laminar flow regime without requiring external fields (e.g., electric or magnetic).

# Instructions

Below is a brief overview of how we go from a **3D-printed mold** to a **final microfluidic device**, following approaches described in the microfluidics literature (e.g., _Lab on a Chip_ methods):

1. **CAD Model**  
   - Design the mold in Fusion 360, ensuring the pinch region, outlets, and channel dimensions match the desired particle sizes. Keep in mind printer resolution and plan for uniform flow paths to each outlet.

2. **Print and Cure Mold**  
   - Print the mold using a high-resolution resin printer.  
   - Post-process by washing, drying, and performing a brief UV/heat cure so that the mold surface is fully hardened and free of uncured resin.

3. **Parylene Device**  
   - Optionally, coat the mold with parylene to provide a smooth, nonstick surface. This step helps prevent PDMS from adhering or becoming inhibited during curing.

4. **Cast PDMS**  
   - Mix PDMS prepolymer and curing agent (e.g., Sylgard™ 184) in a 10:1 ratio.  
   - Pour over the mold, degas to remove bubbles, then cure at the recommended temperature/time.

5. **Plasma Bond Glass Slide**  
   - Once cured, carefully peel the PDMS layer from the mold.  
   - Treat both the PDMS and the glass slide with oxygen plasma, then immediately bring them into contact to form an irreversible bond.

# Discussion

* **Why are resin-printed molds coated with parylene prior to casting the PDMS?**  
  Resin surfaces can sometimes inhibit PDMS curing or cause sticking, resulting in defects. A parylene coating creates a smooth, chemically inert barrier so the PDMS cures uniformly and is easily released from the mold.

* **Hypothetical applications of your microfluidic sorter**  
  This pinch flow fractionation device could be used for biomedical cell separation, isolation of microspheres in diagnostic tests, or separating synthetic particles by size in materials research.

* **Why is your geometry conducive to sorting?**  
  We designed a narrow “pinch” segment (width sized slightly larger than the smallest particles) so all particles align to one side. The channel then widens, allowing larger particles to deviate farther from the wall. Key dimensions include the pinch width (for initial alignment), outlet width (to keep flow uniform), and sufficient spacing for barbed connectors.

* **Steps or design features to ensure each outlet receives the same flow rate**  
  Symmetrical outlet channels (length and width) help maintain equal backpressure. We also placed outlets far enough apart to accommodate uniform tubing lengths. Even small mismatches in tubing length or diameter can disrupt flows and recombine separated streams.

* **Future changes to improve sorting**  
  - Adjusting channel angles and widths to achieve finer resolution.  
  - Including an additional pinch segment or using multiple stages in series for more complex separations.  
  - Incorporating bubble traps or air-venting designs to avoid flow blockages.

* **Bonus Opportunity**  
  If attempting to guarantee perfectly balanced flows for multiple outlets, one could implement a custom manifold or leveling system. Although challenging, consistent flow rates help preserve the distinct laminar layers needed for clean size separation.
