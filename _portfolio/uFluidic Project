**Introduction**  
Microfluidic devices are small-scale fluid handling systems used for applications in biology, chemistry, and engineering. One such application is **Pinch Flow Fractionation (PFF)**, a method for continuously sorting particles based on size using controlled laminar flow profiles in a microchannel.

**How does Pinch Flow Fractionation work?**  
PFF works by aligning particles along a streamline in a narrow, pinched section of a microchannel. As the flow expands, larger particles experience different flow forces, causing them to separate into distinct regions based on their size.

**Application Example**  
One key application of PFF is in biomedical research, where it is used for sorting biological cells for diagnostics and drug testing. **Yamada et al. (2004)** demonstrated PFF for separating polymer microbeads in a continuous, controlled process. [(Read the paper)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ac049863r)

**Fabrication Process**  
The microfluidic device was fabricated using **3D resin printing and PDMS molding**:

1. **CAD Design** – The mold was designed in Fusion 360, ensuring precise dimensions for efficient sorting.  
2. **3D Printing the Mold** – A high-resolution Form 3+/4 SLA printer was used to print the mold.  
3. **Parylene Coating** – The mold was coated with parylene to prevent PDMS adhesion.  
4. **PDMS Casting** – PDMS was poured into the mold, cured, and peeled off to form the microfluidic channels.  
5. **Plasma Bonding** – The PDMS device was bonded to a glass slide to create a sealed microchannel system.

**Discussion**  

**Why is Parylene Coating Necessary?**  
Resin-printed molds can inhibit PDMS curing, leading to defects. A **parylene coating** ensures a smooth, non-stick surface, making it easier to remove the PDMS device.

**Sorting Mechanism and Design Considerations**  
- **Pinch Width**: 750 μm to accommodate the largest particles.  
- **Outlet Widths**: Designed symmetrically to maintain flow consistency.  
- **Port Locations**: Optimized to prevent flow disruption and particle recombination.  

**Equal Flow Rate Distribution**  
A major challenge in PFF is maintaining equal flow rates at the outlets. This was achieved by:  
- **Ensuring equal outlet lengths** to minimize backpressure differences.  
- **Using a leveling system** to prevent gravity-driven flow variations.  
- **Testing and calibrating** the device to confirm separation efficiency.

**Future Improvements**  
Based on testing, potential improvements include:  
- **Optimizing the pinch segment shape** for better alignment of particles.  
- **Incorporating asymmetric PFF (AsPFF)** for enhanced separation.  
- **Using pressure-driven flow control** to fine-tune separation efficiency.
